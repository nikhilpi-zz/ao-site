As a committee member, you are responsible for booking and facilitating each event. Members negotiate with agents and learn the ins and outs of the world of professional comedy. Creativity, organization, professionalism, and people skills enable members to execute events that make the campus laugh and think throughout the year. Speakers committee members must be deeply interested in the comedy world and passionate about bringing the best possible speakers to Northwestern’s campus.</p>

A&O produces concerts for the entire Northwestern community, so it is extremely important that Concerts members listen to a wide range of music and keep their ears to the ground for up-and-coming artists. Members not only help select artists, but are also responsible for negotiating with agents, sending offers, and handling contracts. Members work directly with industry professionals and will gain real-world industry experience through A&O.<br>
Concerts is typically the smallest on A&O, and so members are expected to be enthusiastic and willing to actively participate in discussion. Being a member of this committee requires a lot of hard work, and members must be extraordinarily dedicated, but ultimately they are gratifed to see hundreds of students united in excitement for the artists whom they bring.</p>

Stay tuned for our regularly scheduled programming, because Films is A&O’s most consistent and profitable committee. Films is responsible for screening recently released films almost every other week, with a lineup ranging all the way from mega-blockbusters to small independent films. We also co-sponsor screenings with other student groups and host free pre-screenings of movies before they are released in theaters. For 34 years, A&O Films has produced B-Fest, our annual 24-hour B-movie festival in the winter quarter, which attracts crowds from all over the world. Finally, we have added an annual speaker series event where we bring a prominent member of the film industry to campus for a screening and Q&A.</p>

Our goal is not only to craft a cohesive A&O board, but to make A&O events more enjoyable for the whole student body. Members of the Development committee will collaborate to plan all-board social events, work alongside the chairmen on guiding the Street Team, and manage all A&O co-sponsorships with other student groups. We work closely with members of Concerts, Speakers, and Films to develop new ideas to improve and develop A&O’s programming. Whether
it be spearheading a huge co-sponsorship to bring Ava Duvernay for a Q&A and a screening of Selma, or planning an all-board karaoke night, the Development committee is responsible for how A&O interacts with its own members, its alumni, and other student groups.</p>

a year learning about A&O culture, shows, and people--all while getting the opportunity to work, produce, and collaborate with the existing seven committees. In short, while Street Teamers are not formally members of one of the seven committees, they are mentored by the A&O co-chairs as their own unique committee. Most current A&O board and exec members started on this team! First-year students will be placed on the Street Team through applying to one or more committees that interest them.</p>
